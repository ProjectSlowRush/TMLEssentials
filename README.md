# TMLEssentials

Essential tools for modding Terraria

## Armor Previewer
The first tool added is an Equip Texture previewer, which allows you to preview relevant animations of your armor sets before having to build, compile, and play your mods. Also included are a couple basic playback controls for animations.

This tool is meant to be a spiritual successor to Mirsario's 1.3 ArmorHelper, and as time goes, it will be given more features and updates.
